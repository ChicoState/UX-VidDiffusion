# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

During this sprint, the UX team focused on refining the user requirements for the UX design of our application. Our biggest goal during this sprint was developing an initial design of our applications UX to see what aspects we need to work for for different kinds of audiences that will be employing our applicaion to reach their goal. Through initial design implementations and layouts we were able to devise a better sprint 3 plan for what we will need to work on to make our UX compliant to industry standards and user expectations on all processes.

## Methods

<!---
!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!
--->
We used two methods during Phase II of testing.
### Cognitive Walkthrough
The first method was to perform a cognitive walkthrough. We created a wireframe that would describe the interface of VidDiffusion. Then we recruited fellow UX designers to pick one of scenario from the scenarios that we came up with in Phase I and walk through our wireframes to see if they could complete the task that the scenario describes. We asked the designers to walk through each panel of our wireframes and answer two questions for each panel in relationship to complete the goal stated in the scenario:
- Will the user know what to do at this step?
- If the user does the right thing, will the user know that they did the right thing and is making progress toward the goal?  
The purpose of cognitive walkthrough is to provide us task specific feedback that may not be able to get by doing other sorts of research methods such as Heuristic Evaluation.

### Informal Feedback
The other method we used during Phase II was informal feedback. We came up with three questions that we would like our potential users to answer to get ideas of what we could improve on or what kind of features we should add to the software. The questions we came up with were:
- What kind of features do you think would be useful?
- What kind of presets do you think would be most popular?
- Are there any aspects of the demo what you found confusing?
We handed these questions off to the software engineering team and had them ask the questions to other engineers during their presentation of the minimum viable product.


## Findings

<!---
!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!
--->
### Cognitive Walkthrough
Unfortuneatly, only one of the designers responded to our request, so we could not get as much feedback as we were hoping for. However, the feedback that we did recieve provided some useful information.
- The user liked the way we used tabs to navigate between different editing tasks, such as presets, images, and prompts, so we will keep that UX design.
- The user had difficulty navigating from the upload panel to the editing panel, so I opted to include more navigational cues, like a button that says "proceed to edit", and a back button.
- The user had difficulting determining how to check the progress of the video conversion. We had included a progress bar on the video feed but considered adding a percent indicator, a label that indicated that it is a progress bar, and making the progress bar bar larger on the video display.
### Informal Feedback
- From our informal feedback, people indicated that they would like an option to view a side-by-side display of the original video and the converted video to compare how the video was changed. We thought his was a good idea and decided to add a button to toggle between the single video view and the side-by-side view.
- They also indicated that features such as video resolution, compression, and AI upscaling options would be useful features. We were planning on adding an advanced features option in the editing panel, and we think these options would be a perfect fit in this area.
- For our presets tab, people indicated that they would like to see options for specific artists, directors, and iconic styles. An option to make the video look like a disney or pixar 3D animation was very popular as well. We will try to include some of these features in our design. Finally, people mentioned including visual filters like ones found in applications like SnapChat. If we have time, we want to consider adding this functionality into the project somewhere down the line.


## Conclusions
<!---
!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!! --->

By employing cognative walkthroughs and then recieving informal reviews based on our wireframes with each persona, we were able to come up with a ot of changes and revisions that we need to make for our future version. The biggest being


## Caveats

<!---  !!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!! --->

The biggest Caveat that we encountered during our infromal feedback was that we were only able to get one single response from a nother designer. If we had two or three then we would be able to draw much better conclusions on all the aspects that are lacking or need refining in our UX. Only haveing a single review will introduce bias on what we should work on and how the UX should be like. Additionally, all the reviews were only conducted by designers from our class further introducing a more biased view. As of the reviewers, it would be much more of a helpfull review if they were similar to the personas that we outlined in our repots. This would give us direct feedback of what an invested user would expect from our website.
