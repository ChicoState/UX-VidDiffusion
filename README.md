# VidDiffusion

AI image models are getting better and better but the tools that currently exist to apply these image models to video files are complex and very difficult to use for the average person. This piece of software will condense those complexities into a simple to use product that can take video footage as an input, apply modifications from Stable Diffusion, and produce a video output with an art style applied on top of the footage.

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* Initial design and brainstorming phase for **Project requirements**
* Competitive Analysis:
  - Application: **No easy downloadable application**, only web services
  - Features: Video **upload process should be easy** together with **intuitive labeling**
  - Pay Wall: Most competitors **employ pay wall** to make product usable
* User Stories / Personas:
  - Audience: target for **extreme beginners** getting into video editing
  - All errors should be handled gracefully for such users
  - Add **recovery features** for lost work
* Heuristic Evaluation:
  - Most **upload processes take very long** since they have to be uploaded to a web server
  - Same impact on the download speed of the processed videos too
  - Add **diffusion trends** as an important feature

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

* First design mockups of UX
  - Created Sketches, designs, and wireframes of initial UX
  - Molded each **wireframes based off of user personas** and their goals
  - Wireframes were then **citiqued by other UX designers**
* Cognitive walkthrough:
  - **Created for each persona** and what steps they would take
  - Outlines the **differences between users**
  - Gives software team a great **insight into different flavors of functionality** based on each kind of user
* Informal Feedback:
  - Great insight into **missing links between users steps**
  - Outlined what other featured **needed refining**
  - Some features **could be more or less abstracted** based on users

# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

**Executive Summary**

* Final Phase used for **UI Testing**
* Experiment Designed, IRB approved, Test Subjects hired
* Recieved valuable **UI Evaluation**:
  - Minor Features need to be made **more visable**
  - Better comparison between **before and after** video manipulation
  - **More user feedback** when starting/completing a feature
* Potential addition of feature:
  - Supported File Formats could include **Project Files**
  - Promt current Project Save before leaving a screen
  - Advanced Users can Upload their own training data for an entirely new style
