# VidDiffusion

AI image models are getting better and better but the tools that currently exist to apply these image models to video files are complex and very difficult to use for the average person. This piece of software will condense those complexities into a simple to use product that can take video footage as an input, apply modifications from Stable Diffusion, and produce a video output with an art style applied on top of the footage.
