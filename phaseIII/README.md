# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

For the third and final phase of our class and project, we were tasked with conducting Usability tests on other students. We started with designing scenarios in the last two phases that were turned into test tasks for each user. After training and submitting an IRB form, to ensure interviewee safety and proper procedures and protocols are followed, we conducted actual UX tests by employing other students to analyze our prototypes. Using data collected from these interviews, we aim to improve, add, and change features of our application and UI to perfect the main principles of UI:  Satisfy, Effective, Efficient, Memorable, Userful, Learnability, Error Tolerant, and Safe.

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

Our cerated prototypes dont actually represent the functions of all features meaning we had to simulate parts of the tasks as completed by the user. Given our project, the major differences between scenarios and tasks is how the user is able to use the more finer details of a feature. Having lost out on such control of features, sevierely reduced down on the amount of data we were able to collect on each specific feature and its functionality. One example is the text box in our application that would control the output of our program. Since we were not able to simulate an actual text box and its corresponding output using the actual program backend, we were not able to fully simultate if a user is truely able the task without any interfirence.
