# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

For the third and final phase of or class and project, we were tasked with conducting Usability test on other students. We started with designing scenarios in the last two phases that were turned into test tasks for each test user. After training and submitting an IRB form, to ensure interviewee safety and proper procedures and protocols are followed. After an approval from the board, in our sitation the professor, we were able to conduct actual UX tests by employing other students to analyze our prototypes. Using data collected from these interviews, we aim to improve, add, and change features of our application and UI to perfect the main principles of UI:  Satisfy, Effective, Efficient, Memorable, Userful, Learnability, Error Tollerant, and Safe.

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
