# Scenarios

## Crunch Time for Robert Ramizer
Robert is on an extreme time crunch trying to produce a hour long episode for the new
Futurama reboot show. The studio ended up adding a new episode to finish the new season but
no work has been done before that. Our tool would be able to drastically speed up animation
design like that where the user would give the AI a prompt or theme to make the video into
which in this case is futurama. Additionally, on other episodes, Robert’s producer told him that
he had to make a few changes on top of all of his other work. Our program here would be able
to process multiple clips simultaneously, furthermore reducing the workload on Robert so he can
fully focus on the plot.

## Apocalypse story for Joe Johnson
Joe wants to make a story about an apocalyptic event occurring in a small town in America. He
has video footage of the area, where drug crime regularly occurs. There are tents and homeless
people on the street, but he feels like this footage is still too boring and tells an overused story.
He wants to modify the footage to add dark skies, buildings on fire, and anything else that
makes the area look like the apocalypse has occurred. As it is, he doesn’t have enough money
to hire a professional to edit all of his footage. If only there were some easy solution to add
these effects to his footage.
